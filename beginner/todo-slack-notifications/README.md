## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to see the embedded workflow builder in your app within minutes.

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd beginner/todo-slack-notifications
# or on Windows
cd embed-workflow-demos\beginner\todo-slack-notifications
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Embed Workflow

**Prerequisites:** You need an Embed Workflow account. [Sign up here](https://embedworkflow.com) if you don't have one.

Copy the `.env.template` to `.env.local` and add your keys:

```bash
cp .env.template .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your actual keys:

```bash
EMBED_WORKFLOW_SK=your_secret_key_here
EMBED_WORKFLOW_PK=your_publishable_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMBED_WORKFLOW_PK=your_publishable_key_here
EMBED_WORKFLOW_UI_VERSION=x.x.x
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMBED_WORKFLOW_UI_VERSION=x.x.x

# Optional: Set a default user for workflows (defaults to 'main')
# EMBED_WORKFLOW_DEFAULT_USER=main
```

**Note:** Check the latest UI version at https://embedworkflow.com/ui-version

**Get Your API Keys:**

![alt text](media/image.png)

1. Log into your [Embed Workflow account](https://embedworkflow.com/app)
2. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí API Keys  
3. Copy your Secret Key and Publishable Key
4. Update the `.env.local` file with your actual keys

**User-Specific Workflows:** Each user has their own set of workflows and automations. The app uses `EMBED_WORKFLOW_DEFAULT_USER` (defaults to 'main') to determine which user's workflows to load. This is important because:

- Each user can have different workflows
- Tasks and automations are isolated per user

Change the user by setting `EMBED_WORKFLOW_DEFAULT_USER` in your `.env.local` file.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 5. Experience Your Embedded Automation Platform

1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2. Click the **"Workflows"** tab

### 6. You're Ready to Build!

üéâ **This is it!** You've successfully embedded a complete automation platform into your Todo app. No redirects, no external tools - your users can now create workflows and powerful automations without ever leaving your application.

**What's Next?** Set up your triggers and create your first workflow in the section below.

---

## Configure Your Workflows

Now that you've seen the embedded builder, let's set up the triggers and workflows for the Todo app.

### 1. Create Triggers

In your Embed Workflow dashboard, navigate to the Triggers tab and create these triggers:

![Embed Workflow Triggers Tab](media/embed-workflow-triggers-tab.png)

**Steps to Create a Trigger:**
1. Go to your Embed Workflow dashboard
2. Click on the "Triggers" tab
3. Click "New Trigger"
4. Configure the fields using the YAML configurations below
5. Click **"Publish Changes"** to make your triggers active

**Understanding Variable vs Data Path:**

![Trigger Data Schema Configuration](media/trigger-data-schema-config.png)

- **Variable:** The name you'll use to reference this data in your workflow actions (e.g., `task_name`, `task_description`)
- **Data Path:** The actual path in the JSON data your application sends (e.g., `task_id`, `task_name`)

The Variable appears in your action configurations as `{{variable_name}}`, while the Data Path tells Embed Workflow where to find that data in your API payload.

#### Task Created Trigger

```yaml
event: "todo_list_item_created"
icon:
  type: "bolt"
  background_color: "slate"
groups: []
data_input_schema:
  - type: "String"
    required: true
    variable: "task_id"
    data_path: "task_id"
    display_label: "Task ID"
  - type: "String"
    required: true
    variable: "task_name"
    data_path: "task_name"
    display_label: "Task Name"
  - type: "String"
    required: true
    variable: "task_description"
    data_path: "task_description"
    display_label: "Task Description"
  - type: "Date"
    required: true
    variable: "created_at"
    data_path: "created_at"
    display_label: "Created At"
title: "Task Created"
description: "A task was created"
```

#### Task Completed Trigger

**Pro tip:** Duplicate the Task Created trigger and modify these fields:

```yaml
event: "todo_list_item_completed"
title: "Task Completed"
description: "A task was completed"
data_input_schema:
  # Same as Task Created, but replace "created_at" with:
  - type: "Date"
    required: true
    variable: "completed_at"
    data_path: "completed_at"
    display_label: "Completed At"
```

### 2. Create Workflows

Now you can build workflows directly in your embedded application! 

1. **Access the Workflow Builder**
   - In your Todo app, click the "Workflows" tab
   - Click "Open Workflow Builder" to access your embedded workflow builder

2. **Create Your First Workflow**
   - Click "New Workflow" in the embedded builder
   - Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Send Email on Task Creation")
   - Select your Task Created trigger
   - Click the **+** sign below the trigger to add your first action
   - Choose an action (like Send Email) from the available options
   - Each action shows additional **+** signs where you can branch and add more actions
   - Build your workflow tree by adding actions in sequence or parallel branches
   - Make sure your workflow is **turned On** (check the toggle switch)
   - Click **"Publish Changes"** to save and activate your workflow

3. **Available Actions**
   Embed Workflow provides pre-built actions you can use immediately:
   - **Send Email** - Send automated emails
   - **Send Direct Message** - Send private Slack messages to users
   - **Send Message** - Send Slack messages to channels
   - **Ask ChatGPT** - Get AI responses and insights
   - **Trigger** - Start other workflows
   - **Condition** - Add conditional logic to workflows
   - **WaitUntil** - Wait for specific conditions
   - **Delay** - Add time delays between actions

4. **Example Email Workflow**
   When configuring the Send Email action, click the red **+** sign next to each field to add variables from your trigger:
   - **To:** `user@example.com` 
   - **Subject:** `New Task: {{task_name}}`
   - **Body:**
     ```
     A new task has been created:
     
     Task: {{task_name}}
     Description: {{task_description}}
     Created: {{created_at}}
     
     Best regards,
     Todo App Team
     ```

For detailed Slack configuration, see the [Slack Setup](#slack-configuration) section below.

## Using the Application

### Task Management

1. **Create Tasks** - Add task name and description
2. **Complete Tasks** - Click to toggle completion status
3. **Automatic Notifications** - Workflows trigger on task events

## Implementation Notes

- Tasks stored in local text file
- Real-time API communication with Embed Workflow
- Automatic trigger activation on task events

## Slack Configuration

Slack notifications require additional setup beyond the basic workflow configuration. This section covers the necessary steps to integrate Slack messaging into your workflows.

### 1. Create Slack Bot Connection

Before using the "Send Message" action, you need to create a Slack connection:

1. **Create New Connection**  
   When configuring the "Send Message" action, click "Create a new connection"

2. **Set Connection Name**  
   Give your connection a descriptive name like "Bot Token" or "My Slack Bot"

3. **Configure Bot Token**  
   Enter your Slack Bot Token (starts with `xoxb-`)

### 2. Choose Your Slack Action

Embed Workflow provides two Slack messaging options that automatically load all available users, channels, and groups from your workspace:

- **Send Message** - Send messages to channels or groups
- **Send Direct Message** - Send private messages directly to users

### 3. Configure Send Message Action (for channels/groups)

Once your Slack connection is set up, configure the Send Message action with these fields:

**Connection Name:** Bot Token (or your chosen connection name)

**Channel:** `demo`
- Select a specific channel to send the message to
- Examples: `#general`, `#notifications`, `demo`

**Message (for task assignment to team channel):** 
```

## How it was implemented?

### Embedded Workflow Implementation

The embedded workflow builder is implemented in `/pages/workflows/[id].js`. Here are the key code blocks:

### Embed the Workflow Builder

For complete documentation on embedding and authentication, see: [Embed Workflow Quick Start Guide](https://docs.embedworkflow.com/getting-started/quick-start)

First, add the following script tag to your HTML:

```html
<!-- Load CSS / JS -->
<!-- Check latest version at: https://embedworkflow.com/ui-version -->
<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen" href="https://cdn.ewf.to/ewf-REPLACE_ME_WITH_LATEST_UI_VERSION.css">
<script src="https://cdn.ewf.to/ewf-REPLACE_ME_WITH_LATEST_UI_VERSION.js"></script>

<!-- Mounted App -->
<div class="EWF__app" data-base-path="workflows"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  EWF.load("REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_PK", { jwt: "REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_JWT" });

  // For testing purposes, you can use a temporary user token instead of a JWT.
  // Note: This token will expire - you'll need to refresh the page and update the token when it does.
  // EWF.load("REPLACE_ME_WITH_YOUR_PK", { userToken: "YOUR_TEMPORARY_USER_TOKEN_HERE" });
</script>
```

### Implementation in Next.js

In the actual Next.js implementation, the version is loaded dynamically from environment variables:

**1. Loading the Embed Workflow UI:**
```jsx
// Version comes from NEXT_PUBLIC_EMBED_WORKFLOW_UI_VERSION in .env.local
const version = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_EMBED_WORKFLOW_UI_VERSION || '1.5.0';

const script = document.createElement("script");
script.src = `https://cdn.ewf.to/ewf-${version}.js`;

script.onload = () => {
  loadWorkflows();
};
```

**2. Embedding Container:**
```jsx
<div
  className="EWF__app"
  data-base-path="workflows"
></div>
```

**3. Initialization:**
```jsx
const loadWorkflows = () => window.EWF.load(embedWorkflowPk, { 
  jwt: token
});
```

**4. JWT Token Generation:**
```jsx
const payload = {
  sub: id, // user's unique identifier
  iat: currentTime,
  exp: currentTime + 60 * 60,
  discover: true
};
const token = JWT.sign(payload, secret, { algorithm: "HS256" });
```

### How Embedded Workflow Receives Variables

When your application triggers a workflow, it sends data to Embed Workflow through API calls. Here's how the variables flow from your app to your workflows:

**1. Trigger API Call:**
Your application sends a POST request to trigger workflows:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/trigger-workflow', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    event: 'todo_list_item_created',
    data: {
      task_id: '12345',
      task_name: 'Complete project documentation',
      task_description: 'Write comprehensive docs for the new feature',
      created_at: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  })
});
```

**2. Server-side Processing:**
The `/pages/api/trigger-workflow.js` endpoint forwards this data to Embed Workflow:
```javascript
const payload = {
  event: eventName,
  execution_data: eventData,
  user_key: 'main'  // or the specific user key
};

const response = await fetch('https://embedworkflow.com/api/v1/trigger', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.EMBED_WORKFLOW_SK}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
});
```

**3. Variable Mapping:**
Embed Workflow maps the incoming data to your trigger's schema:
- `data.task_id` ‚Üí `{{task_id}}` variable
- `data.task_name` ‚Üí `{{task_name}}` variable  
- `data.task_description` ‚Üí `{{task_description}}` variable
- `data.created_at` ‚Üí `{{created_at}}` variable

**4. Using Variables in Actions:**
These variables become available in your workflow actions:
```
Subject: New Task: {{task_name}}
Body: Task "{{task_description}}" was created on {{created_at}}
```
